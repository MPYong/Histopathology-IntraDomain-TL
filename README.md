This project explored an improved transfer learning scheme named intra-domain transfer learning, which transferring knowledge between the datasets of similar domain instead of between datasets of different domain, thus facilitating more effective knowledge transfer and improved model performance.
In this project, the intra-domain transfer learning was applied on the histopathology datasets. Therefore, the models were pretrained on a histopathology dataset before being transferred to another histopathology dataset.

A total of four datasets were used in this project covering from pretrained datasets to target datasets, namely:
